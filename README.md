# MNIST_using_GANS
in this project, I used GANs to generate data similar to MNIST dataset, and it can be a good tutorial for beginners who know CNN.
The MNIST database is a dataset of handwritten digits. It has 60,000 training samples. 
Each image is represented by 28x28 pixels, each containing a value 0 - 255 with its grayscale value.

It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal effort on preprocessing and formatting.

There are four files available, which contain separate train and test, and images and labels, but in this project, we only use train set.
